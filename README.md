Empirical-CheckStyle
====================

### Some issues and ideas:

* How will you define "famous". By activity, stars?
* It would be interesting to note who the committer was to detect if changes emerge from particular users.
* You might want to take special care to think about how to handle merges from pull requests (or not handle), which would mean bringing in code from a non-contributor.

### Related Work:

* [Prioritizing Warning Categories by Analyzing Software History](https://github.ncsu.edu/CSC510-Fall2014/Empirical-CheckStyle/blob/master/papers/Warnings.pdf?raw=true)

If done well and at a large enough scale, this can make for a nice research paper.
